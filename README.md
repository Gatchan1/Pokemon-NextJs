Hello! This was my first project done using **Next.js**.
I explored the distinction between server side and client side rendering, css modules usage, and image optimization.

The project is written in **TypeScript** and makes API calls to the famous **PokeApi** (using native fetch).

The app has a search bar, lazy loading for the pokemon list, and image skeletons for a better user experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
### Check out the deploy at https://gatchan1.github.io/Pokemon-NextJs/

But if you want to run it locally, clone this repo and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
